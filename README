Dogmatic is a Vim plugin that disables the arrow keys and lets you know how
often you try to use them.

I don't recommend Dogmatic for new Vim users, but once you are ready to
fully embrace Vim you should find this plugin to be helpful in leveling up
your muscle memory of Vim's movement mappings.

Dogmatic does not prevent you from using the arrow keys on the cmdline.
